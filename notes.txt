==== Observations ====

Illegal memory accesses:
	-How do we release memory and pages after crashing the process??

-Buffer user memory
	- We should probably verify if the whole length of the given buffers are valid.

==== Modified files ====

*-process.c:

	-Modified setup_stack()
	-implementing passing arguments
	-modified load() to acomodate args
	-added argument passing in setup_stack(). Functionality probably won't look but good layout
	-I changed three return TID_ERROR to PID_ERROR
	- process_exit()

*-process.h:
	
	-Added arguments struct
	-function prototypes
	-SEMA_LOAD increases if process loads correctly

*-syscall.c:
	-validate pointer function
	-get_word function
	-added file lock
	-functional syscall handler
	-sys_halt function
	-sys_open
	-sys_close
	-sys_filesize
	-sys_exit (incomplete) 
	-sys_exec (SEMA_LOAD CHECK)
	-sys_tell completed

*-syscall.h:	
	-added function prototypes

*-thread.c
	-initialized new properties
	-added code required for sys_exec (semaphores and loading)
	-added list initializers to init_thread (to account for the main thread).

*-thread.h
	-added children list property	(NOT WORKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
	-added open_files list property
	-added parent thread property
	-added fd_list list property to represent file descriptors of thread
	-added current_fd property to represent current fd(may not need)?

*-file.h
	-added new open_file_elem struct (to handle files open by a process).

*-exception.c
	-changed line 93 to sys_exit(-1) to be closed as a user program not a kernel
	-added #include "userprog/syscall.h"

==== Modified files ====

*-syscall.c
	-Added skeleton for mmap and munmap, recommended implementation of this is after frame and page stuff

*-page.c
	-started the skeleton of this file

*-page.h
	-started adding stuff, did not complete the frame struct yet.
